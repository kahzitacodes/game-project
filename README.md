# Twig vs Forest

My first project for the Web Development bootcamp is a game I've called Twig vs Forest.

It's a platform-style game called Twig vs Forest.

The player must control the character to cross the forest and defeat the enemies that come along the way. You gain points for each enemy destroyed and you lose a life when you are attacked.

I chose this type of game because it was part of my childhood. Also, I followed a very detailed tutorial from the Franks Laboratory channel.
